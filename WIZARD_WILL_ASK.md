# ✅ THE WIZARD WILL ASK FOR YOUR OPENAI KEY!

## Current Status:
- ❌ **OpenAI API Key: MISSING** 
- ✅ Telegram Bot Token: Set
- ✅ Other configs: Set

## What Will Happen When You Run the Wizard:

1. **Wizard detects missing OpenAI key**
2. **Shows:** "❌ OpenAI API key is missing!"
3. **Shows:** "Some required configurations are missing."
4. **Shows:** "➤ OpenAI API Key is REQUIRED and MISSING"
5. **Prompts you to enter your OpenAI API key**

## To Run the Wizard:

```bash
python setup_wizard.py
```

or

```bash
python start.py
```

## The Fixed Logic:

The wizard now:
- **ALWAYS** checks if OpenAI key is missing
- **ALWAYS** asks for it if missing
- **NEVER** skips required keys even if optional ones are set
- **ONLY** allows skipping if BOTH required keys (OpenAI + Telegram) are present

## What You'll See:

```
❌ OpenAI API key is missing!
⚠️  Incomplete configuration found

Some required configurations are missing.
Let's set them up now!
Press Enter to continue...
